# Parkinson-RandomForest
using RandomForest for detecting Parkinson Disease
## DISCRIPTION
> In this Project, I use OpenCV and machine learning to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure lower among Parkinson’s patients — this was especially pronounced for patients with a more acute/advanced forms of the disease.One of the symptoms of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the muscles, making it harder to draw smooth spirals and waves.After reviewing the dataset, I use the HOG image descriptor to quantify the input images and then how we can train a Random Forest classifier on top of the extracted features.

## DATASET
> We’ll then examine our dataset of drawings gathered from both patients with and without Parkinson’s.The dataset we’ll be using here today was curated by `Adriano de Oliveira Andrade and Joao Paulo Folado` from the [NIATS of Federal University of Uberlândia](http://www.niats.feelt.ufu.br/en/node/81),The dataset itself consists of 204 images and is pre-split into a training set and a testing set, consisting of:
> * Spiral: 102 images, 72 training, and 30 testing
> * Wave: 102 images, 72 training, and 30 testing
> you can see the sample of dataset as below :
